# Language-and-Gender-Website

Greetings!

I made this website for my Language and Gender course final project. We were tasked to conduct a research in regards to our topic and present it an medium we desired. 
With my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript I was able to create an aesthetically pleasing website for my research. Reading research papers can be tiring and lengthy. 
Thus, publishing research papers in a more accessible way can help promote free knowledge to everyone. 

In developing the dynamic shifting of the elements in the website, I coded a simple switch case for each tab. Although, there are still improvements it does most of its function.
